<b>My Story</b>
<p>
My professional career began when I landed my first job in marketing working as a Developer building mobile products.
Through my work, I worked closely with Consumer data. It got me curious about the field and I started researching about data science. I made the decision to pursue graduate studies in Analytics
at University of Chicago and was one of the first to enroll into the program.
<br><br>
During graduate school, I had the opportunity to travel to Japan on a <a href="http://pire.opensciencedatacloud.org/pire-fellowship/">NSF Research Fellowship</a> to work at <a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html>"AIST</a>.
My <a href="https://github.com/kevalshah90/Mining-Twitter-Data/blob/master/osdcpire_poster.pdf">research work</a> was focused on mining social media text, temporal and location data to build a visual analytics tool. The goal was
to understand geo-temporal patterns in topics of interests.
<br><br>
For the last year of graduate school, I was holding down a corporate job in Advertising working full time and taking classes in the evening. On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevalshahm/">paper</a>, my life was fairly successful.
However, I didn't particularly feel accomplished and didn't quite understand what was <a href="https://twitter.com/kevalshah90">missing</a>(Perhaps, my twitter has some hints). Upon graduating, I decided to take some time off and travel
across Europe to France, Austria and Switzerland. I spent the next year working in different industries, pursuing my interest in Econometrics and taking time to travel more. I worked in Finance, Market Research and Public Policy.
<br><br>
My interests are Economics and Econometric theory, Machine Learning, and Experimental Methods. These days I'm reading Philosophy, Psychology and Economics Books.
<br><br>
I live in San Francisco, CA.
