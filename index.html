    <b>My Story</b>
    <p class="story">
    My professional career began when I landed my first job in marketing working as a Developer building mobile products.
    Through my work, I worked closely with Analytics for capturing consumer information.
    It got me curious about the field and I started researching about data science. I made the decision to pursue graduate studies in Analytics
    at University of Chicago and was one of the first to enroll into the program.
    <br><br>
    During graduate school, I had the opportunity to travel to Japan on a NSF research fellowship to work at AIST. My work was focused on
    mining social media text, temporal and location data to build a visual analytics tool. The goal was to understand geo-temporal
    patterns in topics of interests.
    <br><br>
    For the last year of graduate school, I was holding down a corporate job in Advertising working full time and taking classes in the evening. On paper, my life was fairly successful.
    However, I didn't particularly feel accomplished and didn't quite understand what was missing.
    Upon graduating, I decided to take some time off and travel across Europe to France, Austria and Switzerland. I spent the next year working in different industries, pursuing my interest in Econometrics and taking time to travel more. I worked in Finance, Market Research and Public Policy.
    <br><br>
    My interests are Policy Research, Econometric theory and Machine Learning, and Experimental Methods.
    <br><br>
    I recently moved out to the San Francisco Bay Area.
